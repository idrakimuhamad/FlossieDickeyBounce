# Ads Checkout Backend

This application server was built using `Sailsjs`, a MVC framework for Node.js

## Get started
    yarn install or npm install

## Run the project
    sails lift

## Troubleshooting

If the server in any way didn't get to run, you can try to install Sailsjs globally.

    npm install sails -g
